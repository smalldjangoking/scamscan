## About The Project
![Main Page](https://github.com/smalldjangoking/DRF_practice_META/blob/master/LittleLemonAPI/%D0%A1%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BA%20%D1%8D%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B0%202025-09-15%20011734.png?raw=true)

This project was inspired by the well-known Steam community site steamrep.com which helps fight scammers in Steam trading, adapted for the crypto community. The goal of the project is to provide a platform where users can report, discuss, and share information about scammers, helping others avoid falling victim to fraudulent activities.
The site collects data contributed by users, creating a community-driven database of reports. Anyone can check a cryptocurrency address, website, or profile to verify its trustworthiness before engaging with it. By centralizing this information, the platform helps prevent scams and raises awareness about ongoing fraudulent schemes.
Users can easily submit reports through a simple form, providing details about the scam, categorizing the type of fraud, and even attaching screenshots or other proof. Each report is stored in a structured way, allowing the community to search, filter, and analyze the data. Over time, this creates a valuable resource that benefits both new and experienced users in the crypto space.
Ultimately, the project aims to build a safer environment for everyone by empowering users to share knowledge, report suspicious activity, and help others navigate the risks of online scams.
